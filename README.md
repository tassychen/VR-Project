# ARM Institute Immersive VR Experience: Automation in Manufacturing

## Overview

This Unity-based virtual reality project was created for the **ARM Institute (Advanced Robotics for Manufacturing)** [https://arminstitute.org/]. Its purpose is to **educate users**—from **manufacturing business owners** to **robotic operators** and  **students** —about the **practical use of automation and collaborative robots (cobots)** in manufacturing environments.

Users interact with robotic arms, assembly lines, tooling systems(end-effectors, Human-machine Interface), and learn:

- How automation improves efficiency and safety  
- The role of collaborative robots (cobots)  
- Key workflows in modern smart manufacturing environments
